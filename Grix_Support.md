## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Can't find or connect to a peer?

1. **Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi network** (or use Bluetooth for local discovery).
2. **Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth** in iOS Settings.
3. **Allow Local Network access** when prompted:
   - Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Local Network**
   - Toggle Grix **ON**
4. **Restart the app** on both devices.
5. Ensure **no VPN or firewall** is blocking local traffic.

### No audio or video?

- Check **microphone and camera permissions**:
  - **Settings > GRIX → Allow Microphone & Camera
- Test with headphones removed.
- Ensure both users are running the **latest app version**.

### Connection drops?

- P2P relies on **stable local network conditions**.
- Avoid crowded Wi-Fi channels or long distances.
- Try switching to **Bluetooth-only mode** (if supported).
